            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I lived in Seoul, South Korea, teaching English as a Second Language for eight years. Life as an expat allowed me to immerse myself in Korean culture, learn a bit of the language, travel to neighboring countries, and develop a deeper understanding of the world. This created lasting memories and connections and enhanced my personal and professional life. Most importantly, I met my beautiful wife while I was living abroad. South Korea is eclectic, dramatically diverse, and startlingly unique, and below, I share my reasons why I fell in love with "The Land of Morning Calm."

                           <p>Traditional Korean culture can be categorized into intangible culture, tangible culture, and living culture. Intangible culture includes folk play, seasonal customs, thought of filial piety, and Korean medicine.</br></p><p> Tangible culture includes structures, books, old documents, sculptures, and crafts. Living culture includes food such as doenjang (soybean paste), kimchi, and traditional teas, as well as household goods such as hanbok (Korean traditional clothes), hanji (Korean traditional paper), red clay houses, ceramics, and potteries.</p>

                           <p>Korean food is not served in a time-based format of soup or salad, appetizer, and main dish in sequential order. Instead, all foods of the meal are placed on a single table at once in a "space-based" format.</br></p><p> The Korean meal does not involve passive enjoyment of food that is served one after the other, but is an "active" table in which each person may choose what he or she likes from the diverse dishes on the table. These characteristics of the Korean meal resulted in a unique culinary culture that is rarely seen anywhere else in the world.</p>
